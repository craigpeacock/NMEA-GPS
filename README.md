# NMEA-GPS
A basic NMEA GPS parser designed and tested with the u-Blox MAX-8 series of GPS receiver. 

Works on a PC with ubuntu or a Raspberry PI. 

# Alternatives
If you are looking for a more compatible solution tested with an extensive range of GPS, consider gpsd - a GPS service daemon.

It can be used with NTPd to set the time on embedded systems without a Real Time Clock (RTC) like the Raspberry PI.
